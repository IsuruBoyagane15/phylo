protein_set = {site-specific DNA-methyltransferase, LysR family transcriptional regulator,
helix-turn-helix domain-containing protein, efflux transporter outer
membrane subunit}

STEP 1 - Get the set of bactria species which have all 4 proteins in protein_set

STEP 2 - Download the gene sequence of species in  common_bacteria_set

STEP 3 - Extract gene sequence of each protein for each species and write them to `homologous_gene_sequences`

STEP 4 - Build trees
